<p>Science and engineering are two closely related fields but they represent fundamentally different objectives. Science is about understanding and explaining phenomenon. It is about deriving facts from observations. Physicsists often talk about the grand unified theory, one theory to explain everything (sort of). Biology tries to understand and explain life. Every field of science has some aspect of the world that it is trying to explain. But engineering is NOT science. Engineering is about solving problems, building solutions, everything else is secondary. Yes, you need science to solve problems. It lies at the core of engineering. But science and technology is <em>how</em> we engineer, solving problems is  <em>why</em> we do it. It is the reason for engineering&rsquo;s existence. In India, it is prerequiste that you must be a science student to take up engineering. But when you do take it up, no one sits down and has a talk with you to remind you of the paradigm shift. Your objective is no longer to understand &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;, your objective is to create solutions. Understanding stuff is just the pre-requisite.</p>

<p>There is a reason why engineering graduates were in high demand (at least a few years back). The demand came from all fields, not just engineering or science, sales, HR, management. Ever thought why ? People who hired engineers to management positions were obviously not looking for their technical knowledge. So why were they hired ? Because they are trained problem solvers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Engineering is not learned knowledge, it is a mindset. It&rsquo;s when an astronomer tells you that sun moves 15 degrees per hour in the sky, you say &ldquo;Thanks, here&rsquo;s your sun dial to keep track of time&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a profound yet ignored aspect of engineering. I went through the initial phase of my B.Tech course thinking that if I learn my curriculum well, that I&rsquo;d become a great engineer. It took me a while to get that the curriculum had a huge hole in it. Nobody teaches you to solve problems. It is completely upto the student to develop this skill, the skill which in my opinion, is the most crucial skill of an engineer.</p>

<h2 id="abstraction-in-computer-science">Abstraction in Computer Science</h2>

<p>There is a chance that what I&rsquo;m about to say may be an issue unique to CS. But it is definitely evident in computer science. Consider two questions</p>

<ol>
<li>I bought some groceries worth 225 rupees and paid the shopkeeper a Rs.500 note. How much should I get in return ?</li>
<li>I have a sum total of 90 marks in one of my semester exams. I had scored 33 in my internal exams, how much marks did I score for my external exams ?</li>
</ol>

<p>The answers are quite obvious, 275 and 57. These two problems are quite different in real life. But when you answered these questions you basically did the same thing; subtraction. Question 1 became 225 - 120 and question 2 became 90 - 33. And yet nowhere in the questions do I ask you to subtract two numbers. You saw two concrete problems (pages and marks) and yet mapped it into the same abstract concept called subtraction. This mapping from concrete problems to abstract ideas is crucial. If you saw the above problem and couldn&rsquo;t make the connection, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how well you know how to subtract two numbers, you can&rsquo;t solve the problem. Now, consider the following problem</p>

<ul>
<li>Your friend has 1 million dollars. He, being a rich guy decides to play a game with you. He imagines a number between 1 and 1 million. If you can guess that number he&rsquo;ll give you his money. There are only two conditions: <ul><li> You can ask him questions to which the answer will be yes or no.</li> <li>Every time you ask a question, your prize money gets reduced in half.</li></ul><br>What is the best way to win the most money ?</li>
</ul>

<p>The answer is <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/" target="_blank" style="border-bottom:1px dotted">binary search</a>. There is no difference between the subtraction problems and this one. Here too, a concrete example (the game) is mapped to an abstract idea (searching an ordered collection). Here&rsquo;s the problem. I have never encountered a question like that in my university exams during my 4 years of examinations. Throughout school, you have &ldquo;word problems&rdquo; in math or &ldquo;application level&rdquo; problems ib science subjects. In fact, the word problems that we learned in math goes a long way in us using math with some fluidity. But right when it mattered the most, in engineering, the curriculum drops it. Just like that. No more application problems. Again, the problem has been talked about a number of times. But this is only a symptom of the underlying problem, not acknowledging the <em>why</em> of engineering.</p>

<h2 id="a-case-for-open-book-examinations">A case for open book examinations</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the people who vehemently disagrees with open book exams are aware of what it tries to achieve and how it plans do it. I think people have this idea, that during the exam there&rsquo;ll be a question paper with the questions, a book with the answers and the student simply cherry picks the solution from it. That is not how it works. Going back to the subtraction problems, the question paper will contain the questions, but the &ldquo;open book&rdquo; will contain the steps to do basic arithmetic operations. If a student can identify that the given problem is a subtraction problem, he use the information in the book to solve it. The student cannot cherry pick the solution, he has to be able to design it. The information in the book is just support. This is precisely what engineering demands. Your aim should be to utilize the information resources, not be a container for it.</p>

<h2 id="we-need-this-fixed">We need this fixed</h2>

<p>Understanding the <em>why</em> of engineering has implications that does not confine itself to the field of education. As I said earlier, being an engineer means being a trained problem solver. And India is a country that produces as many engineers as the population of Switzerland every year. Imagine if every single one of them were true problem solvers. There are a truckload of problems, not just technological, but social and political, that are begging to be solved. A country churning out 1.5 million problem solvers every year. Just imagine what it would do ?</p>
