<br>(The reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabali">Maveli</a>, when people were united as one)</p>

<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onam">Onam</a> in recent history when the people of this land were more united. In the last few days we did something many of us thought would never be possible again. We ignored our religion, we forgot our political affiliations, we shed ourselves of all labels other than humanity. Our crisis has taught us that we are capable of being one again. Do not forget that. If we do, that will be the real tragedy. If we forget that we are capable of seeing past our differences, if we forget that inside us there is something that only wants to love, if we forget that we are more than our religion or politics, then the suffering of nearly a million people will have been in vain.</p>

<p>I would like to think that it is no coincidence that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Kerala_floods">floods</a> happened on our independence day. For a nation that may be losing it&rsquo;s way in the dark, we can be the compass, we can show that it is possible to reunite. But for that we need to remember. Every now and then when we lose our way, which we will as humans, we need to remind ourselves who were on that independence day and the days that followed. We need to remember our finest hour. In the end, our efforts may rescue more than people of this state. That may be the task God has assigned to his own country.</p>

<p>Let us forget what others have not done for us, but never should we forget what we have done for ourselves, for then, we forget who we are. We are hope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúA moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.‚Äù</em> - <strong>Jawaharlal Nehru</strong></p>
