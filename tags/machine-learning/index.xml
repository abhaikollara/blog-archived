      <description>It feels good when people appreciate your work. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s as simple as a text with a couple of üëç or ‚ù§Ô∏è or even sharing my previous blog post on their Whatsapp status. Little things like that go a long way in motivating people. So if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this and just remembered someone who deserves your appreciation, go ahead, send them text or shoot them an email. It means a lot.</description>

      <description>Originally published at Saama website
About Keras Keras is currently one of the most commonly used deep learning libraries today. And part of the reason why it&amp;rsquo;s so popular is its API. Keras was built as a high-level API for other deep learning libraries ie Keras as such does not perform low-level tensor operations, instead provides an interface to its backend which are built for such operations. This allows Keras to abstract a lot of the underlying details and allows the programmer to concentrate on the architecture of the model.</description>
