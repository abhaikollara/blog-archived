      <description>It feels good when people appreciate your work. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s as simple as a text with a couple of üëç or ‚ù§Ô∏è or even sharing my previous blog post on their Whatsapp status. Little things like that go a long way in motivating people. So if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this and just remembered someone who deserves your appreciation, go ahead, send them text or shoot them an email. It means a lot.</description>

      <title>The Language Barrier</title>

      <description>A general tip to anyone who is learning to code. If your English is not that strong, use a dictionary. Look up word meanings. They may have multiple definitions, but they generally point to a common idea. Understanding them goes a long way in developing an intuitive understanding of the corresponding concept.
Consider the following words and their dictionary definitions.
 iterate: to do something again and again exception : a case to which a rule does not apply class : a group sharing the same economic or social status method : a systematic plan followed in presenting material for instruction static : showing little change public : exposed to general view  If you are a programmer with sound understanding of the English language, you will immediately recognise how close these definitions are to their meaning in the context of programming.</description>

      <title>What is game theory anyway ?</title>

      <description>There was a time when I thought game theory was a theoretical approach to designing computer games. What can I say, I was young and dumb. At least now I&amp;rsquo;m older ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.
Anyways, I&amp;rsquo;m no expert in game theory, so I won&amp;rsquo;t attempt to teach you what it is. Instead I&amp;rsquo;ll spend most of my precious blog space explaining something else - the prisoner&amp;rsquo;s dilemma. The idea is not really to give you the basic lessons in game theory (sorry) but to give a brief overview of what it is and to convince you why it makes sense to have it as a theory in the first place.</description>
