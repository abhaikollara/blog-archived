About Keras Keras is currently one of the most commonly used deep learning libraries today. And part of the reason why it&amp;rsquo;s so popular is its API. Keras was built as a high-level API for other deep learning libraries ie Keras as such does not perform low-level tensor operations, instead provides an interface to its backend which are built for such operations. This allows Keras to abstract a lot of the underlying details and allows the programmer to concentrate on the architecture of the model.</description>
