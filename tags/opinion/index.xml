      <description>Science and engineering are two closely related fields but they represent fundamentally different objectives. Science is about understanding and explaining phenomenon. It is about deriving facts from observations. Physicsists often talk about the grand unified theory, one theory to explain everything (sort of). Biology tries to understand and explain life. Every field of science has some aspect of the world that it is trying to explain. But engineering is NOT science.</description>
